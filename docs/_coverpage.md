# Scripting API

> A tool to make scripts for Anno 1800

The idea of the project is to implement a scripting interface with Anno 1800.  
The game itself allows users to control most things through UI and, in addition, shipping of goods via trade routes.  
The goal of this project is to expose as much functionality of the game through a C# scripting API.
